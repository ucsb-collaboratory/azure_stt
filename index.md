title: Azure Speech to Text
---

The UCSB Library DREAM Lab has gift credits to Microsoft Azure services. This include Azure's Speech to Text 
engine. This engine includes tools that allow users to get the transcriptions of audio files and
video files in a number of languages.

## Until March of 2023, we can do the following for you:

#### 1. Sending in your audio file to the UCSB Interdisciplinary Research Collaboratory  

This option is best for those who meet any of the following criteria:
- you have one audio file to be transcribed 
- you are unlikely to need transcription services in the future.
- you are not comfortable with coding or programs that require navigating others' code

#### 2. Setting up and using Azure Speech to Text on your own. 

This option is best for those who meet any of the following criteria:  
- you have many audio files to be transcribed. 
- you are comfortable with programming and wishes to tackle Microsoft's Azure Speech to Text, OR
- you are comfortable with complicated and clunky web interfaces.  

**Please note** the above critieria are *recommended* reasons for choosing each option, *not requirments*. 

## Requestion Speech-to-Text
Please contact the DREAM Lab if you want a quick transcription file, or if you would
like access to Azure Speech-to-Text for a more in-depth project.
