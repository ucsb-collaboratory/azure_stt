Microsoft's Aure Speech to Text allows users to get the transcriptions of audio files.   

## This guide explores two methods:  

#### 1. Sending in your audio file to the UCSB Interdisciplinary Research Collaboratory  

This option is best for those who meet any of the following criteria:
- the user only has one audio file to be transcribed 
- the user is unlikely to need transcription services in the future.
- the user is not comfortable with coding or programs that require navigating others' code
- the user does not wish to spend time or effort on building their own transcription service.

#### 2. Setting up and using Azure Speech to Text on your own. 

This option is best for those who meet any of the following criteria:  
- the user has multiple audio files to be transcribed. 
- the user is likely to need more audio files transcribed in the future. 
- the user is comfortable with programming and wishes to tackle Microsoft's Azure Speech to Text.  

**Please note** the above critieria are *recommended* reasons for choosing each option, *not requirments*.
